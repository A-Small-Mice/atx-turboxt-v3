# ATX Turbo-XT Mainboard V3

I hereby publish the third revision of my ATX Turbo-XT mainboard design.
I had my doubts whether it would be wise to share my project, however the fact that keeping technology to myself prevents others to benefit from it made me decide for a release.
Open source is in my opinion the most important concept for all technology of mankind to move into the future in a way which has the potential to benefit all of us.

#Factors for proper operation and stability

Timing issues are likely to occur which require certain components to be of a suitable sufficient type to be able to meet the timing requirements for proper function. The prototype of the developer is proof of concept, please refer to the detailed partslist provided which includes type and manufacturer for all ICs where necessary, however each new build may pose it's own challenges to bring it to success. This design is by nature not a turnkey solution and will only function when using all the components of similar timing and behaviour as was used in the prototype. Determining the right components may likely be experimental in nature and require expertise, effort and persistance. 

Specifically the databus control transceivers and DMA handshaking circuits are most sensitive to exact types of at least equivalent timing as the types specified in the IC list, so refer to that list. The choice of DMA controller is a matter of trial and error, not all DMA controller chips are of sufficient timing to control a floppy disk using this design, specifically a floppy disk format poses the most exact testing situation to ensure proper DMA operation. Manufacturing date variations also may result in timing variations of the DMA controller. If the DMA handshake logic ICs are of faster types, this may also allow a more broad range of DMA controller ICs to work properly. Though I have not verified this with tests. Theoretically, using lower voltage logic or programmable logic may provide faster timing, though I have not chosen these methods in my design because I already achieved proper timing with the components I had available.

The 24Mhz oscillator load capacitors should be used as specified in the design. and the oscillator should be checked to operate properly. If the total load (PCB capacitance + load capacitors) is too high, the oscillator will not run reliably and this will cause crashes, devide by zero errors, freezing, resets etc. Therefore ensure to observe the load capacitance suitable and proper stable operation of the oscillator. The ground shielding of the PCB traces of the clock signals comprise an addition to the load capacitance so the load capacitors themselves can be lower. For a turbo XT, it is not required to use two 8284 chips, one is sufficient. The DMA controller can properly operate on a fixed 50% duty cycle clock within the speed range of the chip. I derived the XT system clocks (keyboard, timer chip) from the DMA clock signal, which are also all fixed clock signals and do not vary when switching the CPU speed. CPU speed can be switched with the keyboard CTRL-ALT-num+ and CTRL-ALT-num- at any moment without crashing the CPU. At least, I was not able to get the PC to crash by switching the speed at various moments.

There have been many capacitor footprints added to the edge of the ISA bus. These do not all need to be populated, but are instead intended for termination of signal reflections. Specifically, active high signals may be sensitive to noise generated from reflections. The best example is the RESETDRV signal on the ISA bus. If there is too much noise on such a signal it may cause certain I/O ICs such as UARTs to operate erroniously. For this reason the onboard UART RESET input has been purposely grounded. Use a 2.2nF capacitor for RESETDRV at least. Certain other signals may benefit from termination using lower capacitors. The higher the frequency of the signal, the lower the capacitor should be chosen as not to cause delays on the signal edges.

Databus transceivers which drive the ISA bus should be chosen of LS245 types which give better stability results. HCT types have better amplitudes but are more sensitive in the system. Refer to the IC list for best choices, though you could experiment after achieving a stable system to see if more HCT types are possible. For driving the SRAM memory databus, HCT types are fine.

This is an advanced project which contains many components, therefore the maximum care should be applied and maintained when soldering the PCB. Where using IC sockets, ensure they are proper quality sockets which are solid enough to create a reliable connection to the ICs inserted. Using sockets on DMA control circuits would be an advantage for trial and error testing to determine proper timing is reached.

After soldering the project, it's a strong recommendation to use proper lighting and magnification and systematically inspect all soldering points to detect any short circuits or open solder joints before powering up the system for testing. Short circuits which are not detected are likely to damage ICs and introduce hidden defects into your project which will be much more difficult to detect after the damage is done. Fuses are put into the 5V and 12V lines which should blow on shorts or overcurrent. Keep in mind the amount of current an ATX PSU can generate also requires care of the project builder to ensure no short circuits occur which could damage components or PCB traces.

If you do not agree or do not wish to accept the above risks and usage terms, do not make any attempts to build and operate the hardware in these design specifications.

An excellent BIOS for XT machines, far superior in stability and function to anything else I have tested.

I have used my own adaptation of [J. Chapman's version(Glitchworks)](https://minuszerodegrees.net/xtide/rev_4/XT-IDE%20Rev%204%20-%20general.htm) of XT-IDE schematic after extensive testing with several circuit and component variations on an Amstrad PPC640. I studied all revisions of the circuits first before creating my own variations.

Amazing and extremely efficient software, fast disk access for XT and various AT computers.
Works with every IDE drive I have tested. Still under active development earlier in 2023.

All source data remains the copyright of the original creators and must be respected.
This design is only released for hobby computing enthousiasts and educational purposes, no profit is to be made from this design or derived work from it.

I have taken time to respectfully include all the above acknowledgements. If anyone or anything is left out, that is absolutely not intentional, please contact me and I will update this page.

After elaborately studying the available source design files which inspired the system, I conceived this design with my own variations, circuit additions and changes which I see as improvements according to my personal design views and preferences. Some logic types I have changed to get a better schematic perspective on an entire circuit area. My purpose was a good clear recreation in my own method, not to exactly copy the original. I have removed the DRAM refresh and parity check logic from the design. The refresh signal is available on the ISA bus for any expansion card designs which use it for timing.

Some circuit areas are deducted from chip manufacturer datasheets to determine the proper interfacing methods in this application for an XT PC.

BIOS choice for operation of this mainboard is up to the builder, the BIOS used in the operation of my build is composed as follows, top to bottom segments in the ROM image are:

1: 8k   Super PC/Turbo XT BIOS (project by Jon Petrosky and Ya'akov Miles)

2: 8k   XT-IDE BIOS file (by XT-IDE universal BIOS team)
Configured to port 300/308 and XT-IDE v2 ("Chuck mod") hardware, image is to be corrected for checksum=0 by XT-IDE config software.

3: 8k   XT HD-Floppy BIOS extension (by Sergey Kiselev)
Configuration of floppy drive config bytes according to instructions provided by Sergey.

remainder: 40k  blank space "00" hex code
This comprises a 64k BIOS image, the design accommodates two BIOS images in the 128k ROM, the page to be used can be switched by a jumper or switch. For testing it's advised to program two identical BIOS images into the ROM first. Initially it's best to use an EPROM which cannot be erased by software if there is any software trying to write into the BIOS region. If you like to add other BIOS images you can simply include them into the BIOS image file since there are 5 segments of 8k available.

What I did is to create two variations of the 64k BIOS, one which includes a DD 5,25 floppy drive, and the other includes a HD 5,25 floppy drive. I have added switches to the DS1 jumpers of my two 5,25 drives which enables to leave both connected to the floppy bus simultaniously. The switches change both the BIOS image selection and the drive selects. Using both a DD and HD 5,25 drive makes sure that any floppy disks are properly read and written, due to matching the proper track width compatibility of the original intended drives to the respective disks. In both of my BIOS versions, I have defined drive A: to be a 1,44MB HD 3,5 inch drive. Drive B settings contain the DD and HD versions of the 5,25 drives.

The onboard RTL8019AS adapter is configured using the 93LC46 EEPROM. This EEPROM can be programmed using a programmer, I will provide a dump image of my example chip. The image also contains the MAC address so this should be varied slightly in your implementation.

I will be appending the resource specification list here in this document for the IO devices integrated into this mainboard.
The LPT port does not need interrupt 7 to operate so the jumper should be left open because of limited interrupts available in an XT.
DMA timing jumpers provide alternatives for testing purposes, the settings indicated by the asterisk are defaults.

For the SCSI bus general practises for termination apply. The 53C400 is very solid, stable and fast and works really well with LS2000 drivers.
A SCSI bus is an ideal period correct way to provide plug-in storage and CDROM access for an XT PC.

I operate my XT PC with a VGA card, the Video 7. Perhaps others like CGA or EGA which requires the correct dipswitch settings. I don't own any CGA monitor and besides I want to be able to use windows 3.0, play certain games and view photos in full VGA format on a modern monitor. I have tested a ATI Small Wonder card to operate properly on the composite output on a CRT.

The schematic diagram is intentionally created as a single sheet for fastest navigation back and forth between various circuit areas. Such a large single sheet does slow down editing somewhat but it's an acceptable compromise in my opinion once you get used to it. It's not the "fullness" of the schematic, but the sheet size which slows down the schematic editor somewhat, which can be lessened by occasionally saving and closing the schematic, and then opening it again. Schematic and PCB design are made in KiCad 5.1.7. I know this is not the latest release however I am used to working in this version and I don't see a need to change that for now since it has proven to be sufficient for this purpose.

This KiCad version is confirmed to be fully compatible with screenshots of JLCPCB guidelines of settings for creating the files for manufacturing. 
I will be including my own KiCad library additions in the source files which need to be unpacked into the appropriate kicad installation shared library folders.

I will not be further revising this design since I view it as completed. 

My next project will be a 286 AT mainboard design comperable to the IBM 5170 and similar PCs.

Thanks for your interest in this project,

kind regards,

Rodney
